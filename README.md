Tree-like File Explorer Interface inspired by Windows 11

This project is a practical exercise utilizing:

    1-React for building the UI components.
    2-Next.js for the web framework.
    3-Zustand for state management.
    4-Tailwind CSS for styling.
    5-Shadcn for UI components.
    6-Lucide Icons for iconography.

Features:

    Tree Structure: The interface mimics the right-aligned tree structure seen in the Windows 11 file explorer.
    Interactive UI: Hovering over each folder highlights its UI differences, enhancing user interaction.
    File Content Display: Clicking on a file displays its content in the left pane.
    Folder Creation: Users can create a new folder by entering an ID and name, using an icon located to the right of each folder name.
